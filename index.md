The MorPhiC programme aims to develop a consistent catalog of molecular and cellular phenotypes for null alleles for 
every human gene by using in-vitro multicellular systems. The catalog will be made available for broad use by the 
biomedical community. The program will start with a Phase 1 to optimize available methods to create null alleles and 
measure their phenotypic effects in a target subset of 1,000 protein coding genes across the program. Phase 1 will 
also assess the scale limitations of such methods, develop common data formats and establish use cases for this catalog.

MorPhiC has three components: the Data Production Research and Development Centers (DPCs), the
Data Analysis and Validation Centers (DAVs) and the Data Resource and Administrative Coordinating Center (DRACC).
